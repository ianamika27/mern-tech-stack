About React Native Javascript Framework

React Native is a cross-platform mobile framework that uses Reactjs for building apps and websites. React Native compiles to native app components enables the programmer to build mobile applications that can run on different platforms such as Windows, Android, iOS in JavaScript.

Whatâ€™s more, Reactjs is used to build components under React Native, and React Native implements Reactjs under their framework.




1. Reactjs can be described as a base derivative of React DOM, for the web platform while React Native is a base derivative in itself, which means that the syntax and workflow remain the same, but components alter.

2. Reactjs, eventually, is a JavaScript library, which enables the programmer to create an engaging and high performing UI Layer while React Native is an entire framework for building cross-platform apps, be it web, iOS or Android. 

3. In Reactjs, virtual DOM is used to render browser code in Reactjs while in React Native, native APIs are used to render components in mobile.

4. The apps developed with Reactjs renders HTML in UI while React Native uses JSX for rendering UI, which is nothing but javascript. 

5. CSS is used for creating styling in Reactjs while a stylesheet is used for styling in React Native.
6. In Reactjs, the animation is possible, using CSS, just like web development while in React Native, an animated API is used for inducing animation across different components of the React Native application.

7. If the need is to build a high performing, dynamic, and responsive UI for web interfaces, then Reactjs is the best option while if the need is to give mobile apps a truly native feeling, then React Native is the best option.
